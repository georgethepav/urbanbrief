        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of the UrbanBrief website and any services provided through it, including the Planning Reality Report and related planning advice services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;).
        </p>
        <p>
          In these Terms, &ldquo;UrbanBrief&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo; refer to
          <strong>[INSERT LEGAL ENTITY NAME, e.g. UrbanBrief Ltd]</strong>, a company registered in
          <strong>[England and Wales]</strong> with registered number
          <strong>[COMPANY NUMBER]</strong> and registered office at

        <h2>2. Nature of our Services</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Planning Reality Report (PRR)</h3>
        <p>
          The Planning Reality Report is a desktop planning review based on information you provide and publicly available data such as planning policy documents, online mapping and published guidance. It is designed to give a practical, experience-based view of planning risk and likelihood but it is <strong>not</strong> a formal planning decision.
        </p>
        <p>The Planning Reality Report:</p>
        <ul class="tos-list">
          <li>is advisory and indicative only;</li>
          <li>does not bind any local planning authority or other public body;</li>
          <li>does not replace a formal planning application, lawful development certificate or pre-application response; and</li>
          <li>does not guarantee that planning permission or any other consent will be granted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Other services</h3>
        <p>
          UrbanBrief may also offer (i) formal planning reviews using official guidance channels, (ii) support with preparing pre-application submissions, and (iii) introductions to third-party designers or consultants for full plans and applications. These services are typically scoped separately and may be subject to additional terms or written proposals.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          UrbanBrief is not a local planning authority, does not make formal planning decisions and does not act as your legal adviser.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>3. Your responsibilities</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Information you provide</h3>
        <p>
          Our work and any Planning Reality Report rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information you provide. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="tos-list">
          <li>ensuring all property information, addresses, boundaries and descriptions are correct;</li>
          <li>informing us of any known constraints, designations or historic planning issues; and</li>
          <li>promptly clarifying any questions we raise about your instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for any loss or inaccuracy in the Services arising from incomplete, outdated or incorrect information supplied by you or third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Authority to instruct</h3>
        <p>
          By commissioning a Service, you confirm that you have a legitimate interest in the property and the right to seek planning advice in relation to it (for example as owner, potential purchaser, agent or advisor). It is your responsibility to ensure that any discussions with landowners, tenants, lenders or other stakeholders are properly handled.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="tos-section">
        <h2>4. Ordering, fees and payment</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Planning Reality Report fee</h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the fee for a Planning Reality Report is
          <strong>£145 (inclusive of any applicable VAT where charged)</strong> per report, per property. The current fee will be shown on the website or during checkout at the time of ordering.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Payment</h3>
        <p>
          Payment for the Planning Reality Report is normally taken in advance via a secure third-party payment provider (for example Stripe). Your contract for payment processing is with that provider, subject to their terms and conditions. We do not store full card details.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Turnaround times</h3>
        <p>
          Where we refer to a &ldquo;24-hour&rdquo; or similar turnaround for the Planning Reality Report, this is a target timescale measured from the point at which we confirm that we have sufficient information and payment to proceed. It is not a guaranteed deadline, and we may extend this period where necessary, for example due to:
        </p>
        <ul class="tos-list">
          <li>complexity of the proposal or property;</li>
          <li>technical issues with data sources or mapping; or</li>
          <li>other factors outside our reasonable control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we reasonably believe we cannot complete a Planning Reality Report in a useful way, we may decline the instruction and issue a refund of the fee paid for that report.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Cancellations and refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Once we have begun work on a Planning Reality Report (for example by reviewing policy, mapping or constraints), the fee is generally non-refundable, except where we are unable to deliver the report or where a refund is required under applicable consumer law. Nothing in these Terms affects any statutory rights you may have.

        <h2>5. Nature and limitations of advice</h2>
        <h3>5.1 No guarantee of permission</h3>
        <p>
          Any views expressed in a Planning Reality Report or other Service are based on professional judgement using publicly available information at the time of review. They are not a promise or guarantee of any particular outcome and cannot bind a local planning authority or other decision-maker.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Policy and law may change</h3>
        <p>
          Planning policy, guidance and case law can change over time and may be interpreted differently by different authorities or officers. Reports and advice are a snapshot based on information available at the time of preparation and may become out of date. We are under no obligation to update reports for changes that occur after delivery, unless separately instructed and agreed in writing.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Reliance and third parties</h3>
        <p>
          Our Services are provided for the benefit of the commissioning client only. Unless we expressly agree in writing, no other person or organisation may rely on a Planning Reality Report or any other advice for any purpose. You must not represent our reports as formal council advice or as a substitute for professional planning representation or legal advice.

        <h3>8.1 No exclusion of mandatory rights</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2 Exclusions</h3>
        <p>
          Subject to the paragraph above, we will not be liable to you for:
        </p>

          <li>any indirect or consequential loss or damage,</li>

        </p>

        <h3>8.3 Cap on liability</h3>
        <p>
          Subject to the above, our total aggregate liability to you arising out of or in connection with a Planning Reality Report or other Service (whether in contract, tort, negligence or otherwise) will be limited to the total fees paid by you to us for that specific Service.

        <h2>9. Changes to Services and Terms</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          When you place a new order for a Planning Reality Report or other Service, the version of the Terms in force at that time will apply to that order. We recommend you check this page regularly for updates.
